## Code Highlights

- CSS Flexbox is used extensively for layout and centering.
- The Ouija board uses semi-transparent backgrounds and stylized text for a mystical effect.
- The planchette position is controlled by JavaScript to visually "spell" out answers letter by letter.
- Predefined answers are stored in a JavaScript object for easy expansion.
- Smooth CSS transitions make the planchette movement visually appealing.

---

## Customization

- Replace `cover.jpeg` and `oja.jpeg` with your own images to change the atmosphere.
- Add more predefined questions and answers in the `specialAnswers` JavaScript object inside `last.html`.
- Adjust styling in the CSS sections to change colors, fonts, sizes, or layout.
